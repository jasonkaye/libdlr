# `libdlr`: Imaginary time calculations using the Discrete Lehmann Representation (DLR)

Authors: [Jason Kaye](https://github.com/jasonkaye) and [Hugo UR Strand](https://github.com/HugoStrand) (2021)

`libdlr` is a library providing Fortran subroutines to build and work with the
discrete Lehmann representation for single particle imaginary time Green's functions,
as well as the stand-alone Python module `pydlr` implementing the same functionality.

For more information see the [documentation](https://libdlr.readthedocs.io).
